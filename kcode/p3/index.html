<h1> Project 3 </h1>

<p> This project was by far the most difficult for me. I had to change visualizations after a while of going
over the material on how to do a countdown clock. Since I wasn't able to achieve my first goal of a countdown clock, I created a standard clock
with rectangles but then I couldn't get the alarms to work correctly. I was not very good at managing my work with this project so this is all I have. </p>
